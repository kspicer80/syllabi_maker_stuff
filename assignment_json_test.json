This week we would seem to have a little bit of everything:&nbsp; we have an absurdist tale of people who are forced to try to squeeze every last drop of liquid out of a really long towel/sheet (Sansom\u2019s \u201cThe Long Sheet\u201d)\u2014a story that will easily remind many of Kafka\u2019s \u201cIn the Penal Colony\u201d (Week 3)\u2014; we have a sample story from one of the greatest Latin American writers of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges\">Jorge Luis Borges</a>, whose \u201cThe Aleph\u201d is a strange yarn about a spot in the universe from which one can simultaneously see every other single spot or space in the universe (bit of a mind-bender, that one); we have what looks like a good ol\u2019 run of the mill ghost story in Bh\u00ealy-Qu\u00e9num\u2019s \u201cA Child in the Bush of the Ghosts\u201d; Shirley Jackson\u2019s wonderful \u201cThe Summer People\u201d is one of those eerie stories that probably everyone should read at some point (and I'm not sure if we have any fans of the TV show that <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6763664/\">Netflix</a> made from one of her books, the rather famous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Haunting_of_Hill_House\"><em>The Haunting of Hill House</em></a> [if any of you liked the TV version, the book version is even better, I would argue]); another story that links back\u2014quite directly and explicitly\u2014to the story by Lord Dunsany that we read in Week 2; Bloch\u2019s \u201cThe Hungry House\u201d which manages to combine a number of different scary, horror, fairy-tale like tropes and clich\u00e9s in a way that produces something a little bit different; and it would be criminal not to mention Jerome Bixby's \"It's A Good Life,\" which has been incredibly influential (the original&nbsp;<em>Twilight Zone&nbsp;</em>did a version of it in their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_a_Good_Life_(The_Twilight_Zone)\">3rd season</a></p><p><img style=\"font-family: sans-serif;

From the thought of H. P. Lovecraft:&nbsp; \u201cweirdness\u201d comes from a focus on \u201cfear,\u201d one of the most primordial of emotions.&nbsp; Thinking about the stories we\u2019ll read this semester in terms of \u201cfear\u201d will get us focusing on some things rather than others\u2014and as we go through the semester feel free to decide if stories that make you afraid are best classified as \u201cweird.\u201d&nbsp; Maybe, maybe not:&nbsp; and why not call fiction that makes you afraid something like \u201chorror\u201d rather than \u201cweird\u201d?&nbsp;</p><p>2.) From Freud and psychoanalysis:&nbsp; here we have this notion of what Freud calls the \u201cuncanny\u201d\u2014this is a feeling or affect that is strongly connected to repetition and things that repeat (Tyson does a wonderful job of explicating this).&nbsp; Freud gives numerous examples of situations that produce uncanniness.&nbsp; One of his most vivid is of his situation of getting lost in Rome and, while trying to find his bearings, he finds himself again and again and again coming back to the same place in the city.&nbsp; It weirds him out, greatly.&nbsp; Tyson helpfully shows many of the ways in which each of us is a kind of place or site of uncanniness:&nbsp; when people finds themselves repeating the same actions again and again and again (I can\u2019t seem to choose life partners that treat me well; I always find myself in the same situation over and over again with every lover/partner I have), this tips us off to the ways in which it is incredibly difficult for us to feel \u201cat home in the world.\u201d&nbsp; Focusing on this angle will ask everyone to pay attention to repetition in these stories\u2014how does repetition make certain things produce a feeling of weirdness or strangeness?&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>3.) Lastly, we have Mark Fisher\u2019s&nbsp;<em>The Weird and the Eerie</em>.&nbsp; This book with its two chapters on the \u201cweird\u201d and the \u201ceerie\u201d give us a nice pair of definitions.&nbsp; For Fisher, the \u201cweird\u201d is produced by the presence of something that shouldn\u2019t really be there\u2014weirdness occurs when two things come together that we don\u2019t ever really normally think of as going together. (Fisher\u2019s favorite example here is that of something like surrealist art, especially the strange ways in which Salvador Dali and so many others would put together all kinds of bizarre things that don\u2019t normally go together at all.)&nbsp; Perhaps an example?</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://stfrancis.instructure.com/courses/1174984/files/62481279/preview?verifier=M1Knb13ssarjUMykpNOdGUDT7CxdHMxpGqf8w3Yn\" alt=\"Rene Magritte--The Lovers.jpg\" width=\"275\" height=\"206\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://stfrancis.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/1174984/files/62481279\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p><p>I know this image by Rene Magritte from 1928 might seem strange to all of us post-COVID here, but this painting is called&nbsp;<em>The Lovers</em>.&nbsp; A pair of lovers kissing with sheets over their faces should no doubt strike as a bit odd, no doubt?&nbsp; When two kiss, we want nothing in between, nothing that closes off one to another.&nbsp; It\u2019s bizarre, to say the least.&nbsp; Fisher says paintings like this are&nbsp;<em>weird</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Now \u201cthe eerie\u201d is different.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fisher argues that \u201cthe weird is constituted by a presence\u2014the presence of that which does not belong.

The eerie, by contrast, is constituted by a failure of absence or by a failure of presence. The sensation of the eerie occurs either when there is something present where there should be nothing, or there is [<em>sic</em>] nothing present when there should be something\" (p. 27)&nbsp; Fisher goes on to give us some examples:&nbsp;</p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">We can grasp these two modes quickly by means of examples. The notion of an \u201ceerie cry\u201d \u2014 often cited in dictionary definitions of the eerie \u2014 is an example of the first mode of the eerie (the failure of absence). A bird\u2019s cry is eerie if there is a feeling that there is something more in (or behind) the cry than a mere animal reflex or biological mechanism \u2014 that there is some kind of intent at work, a form of intent that we do not usually associate with a bird. Clearly, there is something in common between this and the feeling of \u201csomething which does not belong\u201d that we have said constitutes the weird. But the eerie necessarily involves forms of speculation and suspense that are not an essential feature of the weird. Is there something anomalous about this bird\u2019s cry? What exactly is strange about it? Is, perhaps, the bird possessed \u2014 and if it is, by what kind of entity? Such speculations are intrinsic to the eerie, and once the questions and enigmas are resolved, the eerie immediately dissipates. The eerie concerns the unknown; when knowledge is achieved, the eerie disappears. It must be stressed at this point that not all mysteries generate the eerie. There must be also be a sense of alterity, a feeling that the enigma might involve forms of knowledge, subjectivity and sensation that lie beyond common experience.

disturb\" (p. xiii).&nbsp; The Saki story leaves me with some questions, yes:&nbsp; is this ferret really a god after all? what does it mean for the narrator to tell us that when Conradin prays to his god in the hopes that he escapes from Mrs. De Ropp the following:&nbsp; \"But he knew as he prayed that he did not believe\" (p. 55)?&nbsp; Is this a real sign that the ferret is a god\u2014i.e.

Freud famously said (and those of you who are psychology students will know this):&nbsp; \"the ego is not the master in its own house,\" i.e. there are forces within me that aren't me ... there are things we compulsively do again and again that we do not consciously control, much like all the characters in the story.&nbsp; There's even a kind of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_drive\">\"death drive\"</a> (a la Freud) in the story too:&nbsp; all the characters compulsively engage in these same actions that lead to their deaths.&nbsp; As I say, it's an admittedly strange story.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So, what do you all think?&nbsp; Feel free to riff off of these remarks if any of them strike you as useful.&nbsp; If not,
