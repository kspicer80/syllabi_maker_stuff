# ENGL200 D, E, and F: Intro to Lit—Weird Fiction

## Introductory Matters:

Hello everyone! This is the main page for our "Weird Fiction" section of ENGL200D-E-F: Intro to Lit: Weird Fiction. Everything you need to know about the course will be available here: for starters, have a quick watch of the "Course Introduction" (it was done a couple of semesters ago, but still relevant for this time around) and take a look at the "official syllabus" too. (All readings—unless specified otherwise—will come from *The Weird: A Compendium of Strange and Dark Stories*, edited by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer, abbreviated WC below—copies of the book are available for purchase at the USF bookstore.)

**Important Note:**  You will all no doubt notice that there are three different sections for each of the assignments every week in the table below. Since there are three different course sections all sharing the same Canvas course shell, I have separated out each of the weekly assignments by individual section. So, what that means is that each week you will post and respond solely to the discussion board that lists your section number. Which section number you are in should be indicated on your class schedules in the Portal. In other words, if you're in ENGL200 Section D, you'll respond just to the Section D assignments; if you're in Section E, respond only to the discussion boards marked with "E"; the same goes for Section F.
